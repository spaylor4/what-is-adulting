## What is Adulting?

Adulting has entered the popular lexicon in recent years as a term to describe the struggle that is adult life and all the annoying things that come with it. Through analysis of twitter data, I aim to examine what activities people most consider to be “adulting.” Is it paying bills, cooking (or the illusion of [cooking](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/01/kitchenaid-le-creuset-peak-domesticity/605716/)), putting on real pants? And can we determine the tone of the term’s usage? Is it more of a complaint or a mock self-congratulatory attitude?
